This was big incentive for upgrading to series 16 and as a result, many more ppl upgraded to iPhone 16 than in any other year and therefore the Pro and Pro Max upgrades were RELATIVELY smaller than in previous years in comparison to the base models!

I believe the Mediatek demo actually proves that $AAPL are planning something with voice , using the 3gpp 18 rel chips for 2025 and beyond. For 3gpp it will take a player like Apple / Globalstar to make it &quot;glamourous&quot; to have satellite features. According to this article. 
 
Band 254 and N254 will put this in play. I am not sure the technical strategy for Band 53/ n53 at that point but maybe would be still the main assignment for Walmart and other Fixed Wireless combined with Xcomp 
 
&quot;The tests were in the 2 GHz frequency range, making them compatible with S- and L-band satellite transmissions.&quot; 
 
&quot;The announcements by Qualcomm and MediaTek for cellphone chips are a big step toward extending basic 5G services. Satellite providers are now being asked to respond in kind, by adapting constellations and gateways to look and act more like a 5G base station&quot;

Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi notes that reports suggest that the ramp for both iPhone 16 base and Pro models should be relatively normal/strong this year, but iPhone seasonality might be somewhat skewed by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence. The firm suspects Apple&#39;s advertising activity to step up significantly as AI features are released, potentially leading to somewhat different seasonality for iPhone 16.  
 
Bernstein further points out that initial iPhone lead times have historically had limited correlation with the strength of the cycle. With that said, the firm also highlights that Apple&#39;s commentary on its Q4 call about iPhone demand and its revenue guidance for the December quarter have historically not been well correlated with the strength of iPhone cycles.

Analyst Comments: &quot;iPhone 16 lead times are down year-over-year, but early lead times as a proxy for demand have little predictive power this early in the cycle. Historically, first 2-week lead times are directionally predictive of next 12-month (N12M) shipments at the model level, but they don&#39;t provide much insight into December-quarter iPhone build revisions or total iPhone shipments. What‚Äôs more important is how iPhone 16 lead times trend over the next 10 days. We see near-term stock downside to $200, which we&#39;d be buyers of, given that the multi-year upgrade cycle is a &#39;when, not an if.&#39;&quot; 
 
Key Stats: 
‚Äî iPhone 16 lead times in the US are down 33% Y/Y, currently at 14.4 days, compared to 21.6 days for the iPhone 15 at this stage last year. 
 
‚Äî iPhone 16 Pro Max lead times are 22.5 days in the US, down from 18 days for the iPhone 15 Pro Max and 14 days for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. 
 
‚Äî iPhone 16 Plus lead times are longer Y/Y at 10 days, in line with the iPhone 15 Plus, but 10 days longer than the iPhone 14 Plus. 
 
Morgan Stanley notes that &quot;December-quarter iPhone builds have been revised lower 55% of the time over the past decade, by an average of 3 million units,&quot; with each 1 million unit reduction typically impacting EPS by 4 cents.  
 
The firm expects near-term downside support at around $197, equivalent to a 27x multiple on expected EPS, but adds, &quot;we believe that any estimate cuts or near-term stock underperformance will likely get bought,&quot; as the focus will shift to FY26 and the iPhone 17 cycle, which is expected to drive stronger growth.
