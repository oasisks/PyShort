Baron Funds investor letter: 
 
“As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period.”",2024-11-09T20:40:32Z

Some data points to share with the crew:  
 
Despite Irrational MSOS Selloff, some amazingly bullish stuff dropped:  
 
(1) Morningstar re-iterated CURLF, GTBIF and shitcos should not be priced alike (see below).  
 
(2) Hedge funds accidently reveal they sold retail a &quot;you wait for catalysts, while I buy&quot; narrative. 
 
(2b) HFs did not sell a single share of MSOS (no redemptions, zero, zilch).  
 
(2c) I caught one Hedge Fund who is a bull &amp; didn&#39;t sell single share of TCNNF, MSOS (see 2b above), go on Twitter to encourage retail to stay on the sidelines.  
 
(3) Market makers barely saved their $5 MSOS puts Friday, having to sell down more GTBIF, TCNNF, CURLF than usual. 
 
This indicates retail starting to make distinctions btw winners and losers.  
  
(4) My tweet about taking advantage of retail&#39;s mistake of selling baby (GTBIF, CURLF, TCNNF) with baby water (shitcos in sector), is now my most popular ever w/16,000 views.  
 
(4a) If enough people understand market in 2024 is bifurcated with growing gulf btw winners and losers, the BIG3 could see a +50% week or more (see Morningstar&#39;s ratings).  
 
(4b) If invstors realize avoiding day trading GTBIF, CURLF, TCNNF on illiquid OTC makes it hard for MMs/HFs to manipulate prices (by &quot;spoofing&quot;), we&#39;ll see prices &quot;inexplicably&quot; just keep going up. 
 
MSOS bulls should discourage people to buy if  they can&#39;t simply hold for few months until H12025 uplistings.   
 
(5) Kim Rivers tweet - Trump&#39;s Chief of Staff is a bestie. All Floridians (incl Trump). I know some people sold off MSOS bc Trump won when they all should&#39;ve doubled their stake.  
 
And as investors realize Trump&#39;s team RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, even Musk are all pro-cannabis legalization, we&#39;ll see traders jump back in.  
 
The reason to buy GTBIF, CURLF, TCNNF and never sell is that even the worst thing that could happen to the sector (indefinite Fed legalization) is great for them as it puts everyone else out of business.  
 
We know who the winners are. Invest accordingly. 
 
(6) GTBIF monopoly position in MN (see tweet below). With everyone focused on Florida, nobody realized retail was giving up the farm with GTBIF.  
 
(7) Germany expanding rec use. CURLF reported +82% international rev growth and doing so despite fact Germany is in a phased rollout.  
 
What happens when entire nation 5x size of Florida opens up. Or EU (3x size of the US begins opening up)?  
 
I would love to see CURLF rewarded with its stock reaching Morningstar&#39;s $12 FMV so it can rollup smaller players and become an absolute beast in EU.  
 
If retail makes rational moves, capital can be allocated to the best in breed - GTBIF, CURLF, TCNNF and become even more dominant. Virtuous cycle.",2024-11-09T17:47:46Z

If Trump does what he said with 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, battery-grade lithium exports from China will stop, and so will Tesla’s production of EV and energy storage. With China being the largest battery-grade lithium producer and supplier, a halt in exports could lead to a global shortage, driving up lithium prices. This would make battery production more expensive, potentially raising the costs for Tesla and other EV manufacturers. It will take more than one year to find alternative sources of battery-grade lithium. The lithium dilemma will force Trump and Elon to either reconsider or walk back on their threats to China. as shifting supply chains takes time, and finding alternative suppliers or ramping up domestic production could take years. The future of Tesla depends on China, and the current situation is precarious. The $1 trillion valuation is highly suspect given the supply chain challenges.",2024-11-09T16:48:26Z

HFs duping retail to think 2021 &quot;existential risk&quot; narrative still applies to entire sector.  
 
Proof HFs Punking Retail: 
(1) Despite drop this week, ZERO redemptions from MSOS etf.  
 
Not. A. Single. Dollar.  
 
(a) ... HFs know 85% of MSOS now de-risked (CURLF, GTBIF, TCNNF, VRNOF, CRLBF)  
 
(b) De-Risked means:  
For Tier 1s, even Fed decrim delays bullish as small players close shop, further solidifying BIG3 oligopoly status.  
 
Evidence the Giants are Feasting:  
TCNNF printed record SAAS margins this week (61%) and grew market share.  
 
Imagine software margins 2-3mos, before a permanent 80% tax break (as DEA finishes reclassifying cannabis) and while small players are closing their doors.  
 
CONCLUSION:  
By convincing retail to trade blue chips &amp; shitcos w/single narrative, hedge funds get to buy blue chips for shitco prices.   
 
Don&#39;t like seeing it but think it&#39;s simply brilliant.

Going into 2025, listen to fund managers yet still. Tom Lee has been right since the September selloff, and typically Nov-Dec in the final term year is bullish. IMO there is no reason to sell stocks. The future are still ripe for a few more months of gains. 
 
Come late December, listen to the fund managers (not Cathie Wood). Wedbush Dan Ives will be the key one to listen to. He is controlling this market right now, not anyone else. For the past four years, until Trump is in office, I believe we should stick to their narrative. Once Trump gets in, then we may need to be cautious about believing fund managers on how the future year will turn out. If this euphoria picks up, be wary.

Firstly, no position and I am not an EV owner. 

So Trump wins and Elon Musk is now a close advisor.  All other clean energy stocks were hammered this week as a result of Trump winning.  

EVs are much more popular with Democrats/Liberals and not very popular with the Republican base.  Trump is viewed as anti EV.  

If you’ve been to Southern California or the Bay Area recently, every third car is a Tesla.  Now that Musk has clearly aligned himself with Trump, wouldn’t it seem that driving a Tesla now is seen more as supporting Trump/Musk as opposed to supporting clean energy?

If you are a progressive Californian who drives a Tesla wouldn’t you now consider getting rid of it and/or not buying one if you don’t already own one?

I think Tesla sales have to be hurt because he has now alienated his base customer and I don’t think suburban Republicans are rushing to buy a Tesla.",2024-11-09T13:26:11Z

Food for thought: TSLA is now trading 95 times forward earnings for next year.  Also forward earnings include a 30% increase over last year.  This compares with 38 times PE for NVDA, one of the best performing equities in the world, 30 times for Microsoft, and 6.9 times for Ford.  Do you really think the newly formed government will allow FSD approval without full safety considerations?  The new level of PE would be justified if TSLA could charge double for its cars in the future.  However new car prices, especially for EVs have come down.  TSLA is a great company, but maybe we should pause and think before sending the stock price even higher.

The disparity shows Tesla’s valuation is priced far above its actual production capability and profitability metrics. Tesla faces competition across the EV landscape. Traditional automakers have committed billions to EV development, with GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and others accelerating production plans to challenge Tesla’s dominance.

591833991,"$TSLA The $1 trillion valuation is not sustainable as the 60% tariff on battery-grade lithium from China will likely increase Tesla’s production costs for both electric vehicles and energy storage systems, as lithium is a key component in the batteries that power these products. Given Tesla’s reliance on lithium-ion batteries, this added expense will directly impact the prices of their cars and energy storage solutions like Powerwall and Megapack.

The increased battery costs will result in price hikes, making them less competitive with other EV options or conventional vehicles, potentially slowing demand. Tesla may attempt to absorb some of the cost to avoid passing it entirely to consumers, but if the tariffs persist, maintaining margins without raising prices could become increasingly challenging. This could mean higher prices, especially on models like the Model 3 and Model Y, which are designed to be more affordable.

While Tesla might secure smoother and easy regulatory approvals in red republican states for deploying autonomous vehicles on a larger scale, the real question is whether this ambitious venture can deliver meaningful growth as a viable service, given that it is still struggling with FSD.
