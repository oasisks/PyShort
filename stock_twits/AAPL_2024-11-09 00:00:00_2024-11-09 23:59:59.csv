They believe the Nuvia license is transferrable to QCOM because they now own the company but ARM says it doesn&#39;t and they want the license theyll have to buy it. The amount the want is much more because of QCOMs size. I imagine QCOM tried to pass the extra cost of aquiring the license  to $AAPL who said they won&#39;t pay. It&#39;s contract law. Does the original license agreement with Nuvia include a clause that says what happens if the company is purchased by another. If it doesn&#39;t (the fact that are going to court suggests not) then the contract with Nuvia stays the same. The only way I can see $ARM winning is if when they acquired Nu they dissolved the old company and created a new entity.,2024-11-09T18:51:38Z

In the first annual period following the launch of the expanded Satellite Services, the Company estimates that its total annual revenue is expected to be more than double 2024 annualized levels with an improved EBITDA margin.  
 
Excluded from these numbers is upside from, among other areas, terrestrial spectrum and XCOM RAN, which, by their nature are difficult to precisely forecast.

Jay still owns the same  percentage in the main company Globalstar, INC just as we all do along with Institutions and other Retail . 
 
$GSAT now owns 80% of the subsidiary and $AAPL owns 20%  
 
His &quot;aggregate&quot; stake in the GLCC is 44.52% because Apple has 20% , so whatever percentage jay has, and everyone has is split by the  same percentage we already have after Apple gets their share.  They only invested in something Globalstar owns. So everyone else gets a smaller stake in what Apple now has part ownership of in the same relative percentages.  
 
So hypothetically Jay/ Thermo owns GSAT INC at 60%, Institutions at 20% + Retail at 20% then you may say that

Crazy times! What the heck is up with valuations!?! 

I am in the construction industry, things are certainly slow.. the rest of the economy appears to be booming. 

Seems like less money bouncing around small and mid caps. Alot of money sitting in chips with crazy valuations.
