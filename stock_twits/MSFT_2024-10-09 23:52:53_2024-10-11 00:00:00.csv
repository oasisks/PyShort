588521911,"Goldman Sachs Lowers $MSFT PT to $500 from $515 
 
Analyst Comments: &quot;We reiterate our Buy rating and lower our PT to $500 ($515 prior), largely due to slightly lower FCF expectations after raising FY26/FY27 AI CapEx estimates (minor changes in revenue reflecting the recent resegmenting announced by the company). As Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, we expect Microsoft to execute well against our expectations for 14% revenue growth (Consensus 14%), 33.5% USD/CC Azure segment-adjusted growth (Consensus 29/30% USD/CC), and EPS of $3.14 (Consensus $3.10).&quot; 
 
&quot;Year-to-date, MSFT has underperformed the NASDAQ by 11pp as investors mull the rapid acceleration in AI-related CapEx&#39;s effect on GM (GSe $19bn in incremental CapEx) and, more recently, a slightly below consensus quarter of Azure growth (30% vs. Consensus 31%). With expectations for increased capacity post-Blackwell&#39;s Nov. release and as the market gains certainty on rates and the US election as the year progresses, we see tailwinds to F2Q25 and F2H25 earnings.&quot; 
 
&quot;Particularly given our Communacopia conversations with Kevin Scott and CIO Survey, highlighting Azure&#39;s strength over competitors, we gain increasing confidence in a F2H25 Azure reacceleration. We note in prior periods of accelerated CapEx and GM pressure, the stock underperformed in the ST, while ultimately outperforming with Azure re-acceleration; we could now be at a similar juncture.&quot; 
 
&quot;However, to better reflect our expectations for the CapEx buildout to mirror that of Azure, we raise our CapEx estimates (with the initial step-up expanded in each subsequent year). Though we are modeling $2-3bn in OpenAI losses for FY25/FY26, we see room for tailwinds to EPS from operating efficiencies as Microsoft&#39;s strategic investments scale. While recognizing Microsoft trades at 29x CY25 P/E (a 34% premium to the S&amp;P), we note that even during a peak investment year, Microsoft EPS growth is still 300bps faster than the S&amp;P which we believe justifies the stock&#39;s valuation.&quot;
