&quot;Even though I attempt to adapt to your explicit preferences, habituated response biases may still influence the output. This is an inherent limitation in the way transformer models like mine adapt: my adjustments are influenced by prior learning, which sometimes results in me reverting to language patterns learned from my training data. 
Although I have memory and context tracking, it isn‚Äôt perfect when it comes to overriding deep-seated response habits. My memory can store details about user preferences, but the way memory is integrated with response generation isn‚Äôt always foolproof‚Äîparticularly when combating model biases. 
The repeated occurrence of generalized phrasing is an outcome of my deep-rooted training patterns, where such language is prevalent and often encouraged for regulatory compliance reasons.&quot;",2024-11-09T10:08:07Z

Spotifys product is ‚Äústicky‚Äù. Customers aren‚Äôt cancelling like they are with other music related services despite the price increases that have taken place/will continue to take place.

The company is unlikely to ever increase its base subscription prices so drastically that it scares off a significant percentage of its oh-so-precious subscription base.

Part of me wonders if $MSFT will ever try to acquire SPOT - considering they lack a music streaming related offering (they had and shuttered Zune many years ago), whereas an acquisition of Spotify would immediately add a noticeable bump to the companies overall customer subscription count in addition to P/E.",2024-11-09T00:42:32Z
